# Divide-and-Conquer-Binary-Search
Given a sorted array of n + 1 integers with values from the set {1, 2, . . . , n} in which all elements appear once and only
one element appears twice. Find that element. For example, if the given array is
[1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8], the output is 3, if the input array is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 8], the output
is 8.
